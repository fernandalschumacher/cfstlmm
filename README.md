This repository contains the R codes for fitting a canonical fundamental ST-LMM, which is discussed in the following work:
Schumacher, F. L., Matos, L. A., & Cabral, C. R. B. Canonical fundamental skew-t linear mixed models. Preprint will be available soon.

The file **"example.R"** presents an application of the method for analysing a simulated data set, and gives some instructions for applications in general.
